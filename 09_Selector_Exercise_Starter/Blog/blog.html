    <p><span class="borderAroundText">And just raise cain. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Talk to trees, look at the birds.</span> Whatever it takes. Every time you practice, you learn more. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. The light is your friend. Preserve it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. There we go. Trees grow however makes them happy. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Let's build an almighty mountain. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want.</p>
    <p>It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We don't have anything but happy trees here. There comes a nice little fluffer. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Have fun with it. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. See there how easy that is. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. There he comes. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Here's another little happy bush</p>

        <!--<p>You can get away with a lot. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Imagination is the key to painting. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. We'll do another happy little painting. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. You're meant to have fun in life. In your world you have total and absolute power. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.</p>-->

<!--<p>How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. A fan brush can be your best friend. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Use your imagination, let it go. It takes dark in order to show light. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. This is the fun part</p>-->

<!--<p>We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Let's get crazy. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. A little happy sunlight shining through there. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Get tough with it, get strong. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. We'll have a super time. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Anyone can paint.</p>-->
